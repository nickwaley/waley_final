                <div>
				<p>The World Cup is the most watched sporting competition in the world. In all of the previous competitions, there has been a total of 50,897,471 fans who have attended. The Men’s World Cup started nearly a century ago in 1930. The tournament was first held in Uruguay with only 13 teams playing in the tournament. However, the tournament was a great success with nearly 600,000 people attending the 18 games of the tournament. The Women’s World Cup started more recently in 1991 when China hosted. The tournament brought 510,000 fans to the country with only 12 teams participating. Since then, both the men’s and women's tournaments have grown. The Men’s World Cup just occurred in November and December of 2022 in Qatar and the Women’s World Cup is set to take place in Australia and New Zealand this summer. </p>
                    	
           

              
				<p>Since 2011 and up until 2019, the total attendance for both the men’s and women’s World Cup has remained the same. The average attendance too has remained stagnant or even fallen in the last few tournaments, after decades of growth on both sides. </p>

                <h3><u>Qatar 2022</u></h3>
                <p>On the men’s side, we have seen the bounce back in attendance after the pandemic. 3.4 million fans traveled to the small country in the Persian Gulf to witness the first World Cup to be played in the winter. Qatar is a country that has a population of about 2.6 million and to build this tournament, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/sports/soccer/world-cup-migrant-workers.html" title="_blank">New York Times</a>, it needed $220 Million and 185,000 foreign workers to facilitate this tournament. 20,000 also died under awful working conditions.</p>
                <p> Despite all this, there was an 11% increase, according to FIFA, from the previous tournament in Russia. According to <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/sports/2022/12/04/FIFA-World-Cup-2022-Qatar-records-highest-ever-attendance-in-tournament-s-history" title="_blank">Tala Issa from Al Arabiya</a>, the highest-ever attendance in the history of the World Cup since the 1994 final was seen at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar when 88,966 fans watched the Argentina v. Mexico match on November 26, 2022. The average attendance according to Statista was the second highest in history at 53,191 fans per game. </p>
                <p>This indicated that the Men’s World Cup has not just survived but thrived coming out of the pandemic.

                <h3><u>Women's World Cup Rapid</u></h3>
                <p>Unlike the Men’s World Cup, the Women’s competition hasn’t been around very long. The first competition was in 1991, held in China. There were only 12 nations who participated in the inaugural event which saw 510,000 total attendance. This was a decent number of people considering the men’s first tournament back in 1930 had only 90,000 more despite having one extra team in the tournament. The growth of the tournament was promising as well. According to attendance figures from FIFA, in the first five men’s tournaments, there was a 30% increase in total attendance. For the women’s tournaments, there was a 127% increase in total attendance. A pretty impressive statistic considering how fresh the tournament is for FIFA.</p>
                <p>The most recent tournament held in France in 2019 was a record-breaking tournament. According to the BBC, Fifa estimated that the World Cup had drawn one billion viewers for the first time. However, it did fall short of the 2015 World Cup held in Canada. That tournament holds the current attendance record of 1.3 million. There was a 19% decrease in attendance. </p>

                    <h3><u>Current issues</u></h3>
                    <p>Like many sports, the women’s side of soccer has been neglected for a long time because of its viewership numbers compared to the men’s side. Recent reports have even suggested the TV deals put forward to FIFA for the 2023 World Cup have been poor. As reported <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65453756" title="_blank">by the BBC</a>, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said at the World Trade Organization meeting in Geneva,“European broadcasters had offered world football's governing body $1m-$10m for the rights, compared with $100m-$200m for the men's World Cup. Infantino also threatened "Should the offers continue not to be fair, we will be forced not to broadcast the Fifa Women's World Cup into the 'big five' European countries,"

</figure>

                    <p>The President has good reason to feel this way about the TV offerers. As previously mentioned, the 2019 World Cup demonstrated major interest across the world, and the investment required to develop the sport on the women’s side was finally started. Companies like Nike and Adidas began to sponsor more national teams and their programs. As a result of increased investment, The Women’s Game has broken attendance records throughout the last 4 years. <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/4783796/womens-soccer-growth-unlike-any-other-sport-fifa-report" title="_blank">Sarai Bareman, FIFA's chief women's football officer</a>, said to ESPN That "Women's football is on a growth trajectory, unlike any other sport in this world. It's the biggest growth opportunity that FIFA as an organization has but more importantly, our sport, football, has today. It's the biggest growth opportunity there is”. That growth is expected to continue year after year as the sport continues to grow around the world. </p>

                    <h3><u>Time to play</u></h3>
                     <p>Despite the World Cup being held in Australia and New Zealand this summer, it is expected to be the most attended and watched Women’s World Cup ever. Sarai Bareman believes “people will really look back and choose the women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand as that watershed moment where the growth, which is already exponential, just took off to the absolute next level." Will this World Cup live up to expectations? Will this be that moment for Women’s Soccer? Only time will tell.
